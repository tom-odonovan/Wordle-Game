# Wordle-Game

Project 1 for General Assembly SEI

## Project Overview

This project was created as part of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. The aim of the project was to recreate the classic word guessing game, Wordle, using JavaScript. The game presents the player with a 5-letter word that they have to guess within a limited number of tries.

## Demo
